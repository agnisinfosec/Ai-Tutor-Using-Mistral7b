# Ai-Tutor-Using-Mistral7b
The “AI Tutor: Generating Solutions Using LLM and RAG” project aims to build an intelligent tutoring system that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The project utilizes LangChain to structure the interaction between LLMs and vector databases. enabling efficient document retrieval and response generation. It employs
Hugging Face Transformers and Sentence-Transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to
generate embeddings for text similarity search. The PyMuPDF (fitz) library is used
for extracting content from educational PDFs, while Scikit-learn and NumPy
facilitate cosine similarity calculations for document ranking.
By combining retrieval-based search with generative AI, AI Tutor ensures that
answers are both accurate and informative. The project demonstrates a scalable and
adaptable tutoring solution, offering automated assistance across various academic
subjects.
